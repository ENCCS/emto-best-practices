EMTO best practices workshop
============================

.. prereq::

   In case people would like to do some practices during the workshop with the installed emto excutables
   you need to have access to one of these resource:

   - Leonardo booster (CINECA, Italy).
   - Tetralith (NSC, NAISS, Sweden).

   All documented commands for the practices are tested on these clusters.
